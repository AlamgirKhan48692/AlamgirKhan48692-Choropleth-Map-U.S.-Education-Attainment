🗺️ Choropleth Map – U.S. Education Attainment

This project visualizes the percentage of U.S. adults aged 25 and older who have attained a bachelor’s degree or higher. The map is interactive and color-coded by county using D3.js and TopoJSON. Tooltips provide detailed education statistics per county, and a color legend helps interpret the data.
